# Face-Liveness-Detection-System
MTCNN, MobileNetV2

Face liveness detection systems play a vital role in ensuring the security and integrity of facial recognition technologies. These systems are designed to distinguish between live (real) and fraudulent (spoof) attempts such as photos, videos, or masks used to deceive the facial recognition system.

For running the code,

Firstly, run the Liveness_Model_MobileNetV2 at 100 epochs.

or,

Directly run MTCNN_liveness_detector for livness detection using trained weights upload.
